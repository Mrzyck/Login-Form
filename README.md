# Practice HTML Login Form
This is a simple login form created using HTML. It is my first repository as a beginner when learning front-end at HIIT, this is not meant for actual use, i only created for practice purposes.

# How to Use
Simply open the loginform.html file in a web browser to view the login form. You can also open the file in a code editor to view and modify the HTML code.
